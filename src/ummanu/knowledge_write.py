"""Writer for long recoverable documents in `state/knowledge`.

Contract: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Knowledge planes", and docs/RECOVERY.md, "Writers". Knowledge holds
the long reasoning behind a decision: brainstorms, decision logs, incident write-ups. It is plain
markdown in the live root, and `state/knowledge/**` is in the snapshot export allowlist, so a
document written here leaves the host with the next checkpoint (the legacy tick commits it, the
snapshot exporter copies it) and survives a move to another machine.

The writer starts no Git child. It writes files only, under `state_repo_lock`, the live-root writer
lock the tick holds while it commits or cuts, so neither ever sees half a write. A document is one
atomic file replace; a directory is swapped in whole through `state/.knowledge-swap` and put back on
failure. Where a commit id used to be, the result carries the content revision of what was written
(`_fsutil.content_revision`): the same content gives the same revision.
