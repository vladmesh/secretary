"""The small, storage-free rules every audit record reader and writer shares.

A card audit record is one of two shapes: a typed board protocol event, whose ``record_type`` is
:data:`PROTOCOL_EVENT_RECORD_TYPE`, or a released generic record (``moved``, ``edited``,
``commented`` and the rest) that carries no discriminator. Recovery, replay and history readers
all have to tell them apart, and a request id is an ownership claim that a replay has to match.
Neither rule depends on where the records are kept, so they live here rather than on the store
that keeps them (:class:`ummanu.board.sql_audit.SqlTaskAudit`).
