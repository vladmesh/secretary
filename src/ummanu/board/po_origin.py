"""PO delegation: the PO session a card came from, and where its result went (secretary-1792).

A card created by `task create --role po` inside a PO turn records its **origin**: the PO session of
that turn and the request id of the input the turn answers, both read from the turn's environment
(`UMMANU_PO_SESSION`, `UMMANU_PO_REQUEST`, set by `PoRunner.session_environment`). Nothing else
sets it: there is no flag, another role's create ignores the environment, and only create writes it.

Two typed fields of the extension bag (`extensions.extra`, docs/BOARD_STORE.md §8.2), JSON text, no
column:

- `po_origin`: `{session, request}`, written once by create and never again;
- `po_return`: the dispatcher's side, written only by the dispatcher (`TaskWriter.record_po_return`):
  `executor`, the session the dispatcher handed a decision/operation card to (shown, never a proof of
  who completed it: the completion records its own `po_session`); `successors`, per closed
  or missing session of the origin's line the session that succeeded it (route recorded before it is
  opened, id right after).

What the card owes its origin session, and what was delivered, is not here: it is the card's rows of
the origin-return outbox (`board/origin_outbox.py`), written in the transaction of each transition
into Done or Blocked. `task show` attaches them to the `origin` block as `returns`.

The origin's **line** is the origin session followed through `successors`: the session a result or
an out-of-sprint decision/operation card goes to now (:func:`line_head`).
