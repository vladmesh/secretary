"""The normalized board import's write order: the one place it is defined.

Every round of the 1476 recovery drill stopped on one more foreign key the import wrote out of
order -- an Issue before its Product (ummanu-27), then an issue comment before the `requests` row it
claims (`issue_comment_claims_its_request`, ummanu-45). Each was fixed where it surfaced, so the
next one waited for a drill. This table is what closes the class: it names the import's write
phases in the order the import runs them and the `ummanu.board.schema` tables each phase writes, and
`tests/test_import_write_order.py` builds the foreign-key graph from the schema's own metadata and
fails when a parent table's first phase comes after a phase that writes its child. A table added
to the schema has to be placed here, or named in `NOT_IMPORTED`, before that test passes again.

How the import follows it:

* ``history`` runs first (`restore._restore_board_history`). It writes every exported committed
  request and its typed occurrence, and nothing it writes references a board row, so every row a
  later phase writes that claims an exported request -- an issue or product comment stamped
  ``[request-id:...]`` -- finds its `requests` row already there.
* ``product``, ``issue`` and ``card`` are the three normalized record kinds. The card restore
  (`task_restore.restore_cards_batched`) runs them in two sweeps, one creating rows and one
  initializing them, and each sweep is sorted by `record_rank`, the position of the record's phase
  here. That is the Product-before-Issue order ummanu-27 needed, taken from this table.
* Every later phase is a step of `restore._import_normalized_board` in this order.

Two kinds of write are deliberately not phases of their own:

* A writer's **own claim**. Each audited write stages its request in `requests` immediately before
  its effect, in the same call (`SqlTaskAudit.stage`, then the board write), and only that effect
  claims it -- a sprint comment, a restored sprint budget event. That order is the writer protocol's,
  not an order between phases, so `requests` is placed once, at ``history``, the phase whose rows
  other phases claim.
* An **ensured parent**. A writer that names a project inserts its `projects` row first, in the same
  call (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so `projects` is listed in each phase that ensures it.
