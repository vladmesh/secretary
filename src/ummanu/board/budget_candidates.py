"""The budget pass's candidate set: committed card events that may be budget events, not yet charged.

`dispatch.production._budget_event_type` is the classifier; what is here is its **necessary
conditions**, written once in SQL and once in Python for the file journal. Every event the classifier
types satisfies them, over both event shapes (the generic `kind`/`payload` form and the typed
`record_type`/`transition`/`data` form). They are a superset: a transition to `blocked` whose forward
taxonomy owns no budget type satisfies them and classifies to nothing, and the budget pass resolves
such a candidate with a terminal marker rather than making the SQL exact.

An event is *uncharged* while no committed request has the id `sprint-budget-<identity>`, the id its
charge or its terminal marker is written under. That is a primary-key probe, so the set is an
anti-join and not a position: an event that commits late, or whose card cannot be looked up for any
number of ticks, stays in the set until it is resolved (secretary-1661). `0013_budget_candidates`
serves the read with a partial index holding only candidate rows.
