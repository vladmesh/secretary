    Since S1-5 the wait is no longer blind to the worker head it is waiting beside
    (issue fe04011b: a worker sat in `T (stopped)` for 27 minutes while every tick
    wrote ``gate-pending ok`` and only the six-hour ceiling applied). Each pending
    tick runs the same vitality reduction + recovery policy for the worker that the
    report-wait tick runs, so a suspended head sees its SIGCONT within one tick and an
    expired response window reaches the operator in minutes. The gate's own clock
    stays as the OUTER escalation ceiling for the CI rollup itself -- non-destructive
    per S1-4 semantics -- but it is no longer the first thing to notice a stopped
    process.

    What that watchdog may NOT do is undo the gate's own retention (secretary-1539).
    A worker parked by ``retain_worker`` on ``report:done`` is stopped on purpose and
    for exactly as long as this wait lasts; the reduction is told so, reports
