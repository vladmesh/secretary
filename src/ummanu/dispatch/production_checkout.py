"""Advancing the Ummanu production checkout: the target's board schema first, then the code.

Both release paths of `CommandHostRuntime.complete_green` end by fast-forwarding a project's
checkout: the push path to the integration base it pushed, the GitHub path to the default branch
after `gh pr merge`. When that checkout is the production checkout the dispatcher itself runs from
(`production_runtime.product_root`), moving it activates the merged code for every later tick, so
both paths reach :func:`advance`, which keeps one order:

1. pin the target: the ref just fetched is resolved once to a full commit id, and everything after
   names that id, never the ref (which another merge may move);
2. refuse a checkout that cannot fast-forward to it before touching the board, as the plain
   ``merge --ff-only`` it replaces would have;
3. refuse a target that does not keep the entrypoint the live units execute
   (`dispatch.entrypoint_guard`, reason ``entrypoint_moved``): it lands on the remote, and only the
   transition runbook (`docs/RENAME.md` §T3) activates it;
4. bring the board store to the target's schema (`board.release_migrations.prepare`: the target's
   own migration bundle, additive revisions only, under the migration advisory lock, verified at
   the target's head);
5. only then ``merge --ff-only <target>``, and read ``HEAD`` back to confirm it is the target.

A refused entrypoint or schema raises `ProductionActivationRefused` and the checkout stays where it was; the
release turns it into a Blocked card, a typed reason and one operation card for the sprint's PO
(`dispatch.release_lifecycle`). Every other failure is the `HostError` the plain fast-forward
raised before, so each path keeps its own handling of it. A replay is safe at every step: the
owed revisions are read under the lock, so a revision applied before an interrupted tick is not
applied again, and the checkout still moves only through this function.

Checkouts other than the production one (other projects, the instance repository's publication,
a checkout of another product root) keep their plain fast-forward (`CommandHostRuntime._advance_checkout`).
