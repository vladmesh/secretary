"""Does a target commit keep the entrypoint the live units execute? One check for every advance.

The installed units start ``src/<PACKAGE>/dispatch/runtime_preflight.py`` by pathname and then the
``<PACKAGE>`` console script of the editable install, both out of the production checkout. A commit
without either cannot be activated by moving that checkout under the running code: the next tick,
web or PO restart would find nothing to execute. Such a commit may land on the remote, but the
production checkout and its role worktrees stay where they are until the transition runbook
(`docs/RENAME.md` §T3) moves the installation as a whole.

`PACKAGE` is the running code's own package (`runtime_preflight.PACKAGE`), never a literal, so after
a rename the same check guards the new name and ordinary releases advance again. The target is read
from the object store only; nothing here checks out or touches a working tree.

Both movers call :func:`require_entrypoint`: `dispatch.production_checkout.advance` (the release
path) and `upgrade.fast_forward` (the operator path), each with its own Git runner.
