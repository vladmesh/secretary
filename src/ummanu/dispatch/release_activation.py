"""One durable recovery obligation for a refused production activation.

Persist the original refusal and exact board requests in the release record before creation. Every
retry services those requests before another activation or terminal record removal: commit one PO
operation, commit one canonical reason naming it, then Block the source and remove the record. Board
admission failures retain the obligation and leave the original refusal intact. Committed request ids
recover interruptions after any board write without repeating it or consulting a moving Git ref.
