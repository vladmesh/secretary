"""The live root's writer lock and the private instance repository as a commit target.

Contract: docs/RECOVERY.md, sections "Layout" and "Writers". Only two writers still commit to the
instance repository: the legacy tick (`state/board`, `state/runs`, and in legacy mode the live-root
paths the Git-free writers leave uncommitted, `checkpoint.LEGACY_LIVE_PATHS`) and the head-registry
pair of `upgrade`. They own disjoint pathspecs and never `git add -A`. The memory writer, the
knowledge writer and the secret store make no Git call: they write files under `state_repo_lock`,
the live-root writer lock, which is all they take from this module. What leaves the host is decided
by the snapshot export allowlist (`infra.export_allowlist`), not by `.gitignore`, which no writer
here maintains any more.
