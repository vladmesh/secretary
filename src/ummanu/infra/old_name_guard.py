"""The old product name guard: one matcher, two allowlists.

docs/RENAME.md §T5. A path or a line naming `secretary` in any case passes only when a row of the
caller's allowlist covers the match. The product's tree is guarded by `tests/test_old_name_guard.py`
with its own table; the live root is guarded by `ummanu config check` with `LIVE_ROOT_ALLOWLIST`
below, ported from the instance repository's retired `tests/test_old_name_guard.py`: every row
verbatim except the receipt rows the comment at its end names.

This module names the old name on purpose: it is the guard's own source, the one self-exemption of
the product guard's table.
