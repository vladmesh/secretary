"""Health check for every registered triggered-agent.

One line per agent: is the systemd timer active, and how fresh is the last *healthy* tick in
runs.jsonl (a tick that answered counts — precheck-nothing-to-do still proves the timer fires and
the runtime runs). A result of "error" or "board-unreachable" does NOT count on its own: precheck
logs one of those every tick a broken Kanboard/env keeps failing, so if freshness went by the raw
last event a permanently down board would look perpetually alive (fresh error every 3 minutes)
instead of red. "board-unreachable" is the deferred-run record (secretary-964): it is not the
agent's own failure, but it is not an answered tick either, and a board that never comes back must
still go red here. Last `advance` is informational: it can legitimately be days old when nothing changed
upstream. Exit non-zero if any agent is red.

Both sources here are the live data plane, not a checkout (secretary-833):

  * curator/steward/retro write runs.jsonl through `AgentState`, whose root is TA_STATE or
    `~/secretary-data/automation-state` — the packaged units set neither TA_STATE nor a different
    HOME, so that default is where their real records land. Reading a `state/` dir inside the
    agent's worktree instead reported `no runs.jsonl yet` for agents that were ticking fine.
  * the pipeline line is the production dispatcher's own tick telemetry
    (runtime/production_telemetry.py), the record written by the timer that actually moves cards.
    A recorded tick that ended unhealthy is red on its own: it must never be answered with the
    last healthy one that came before it.
