"""Bring existing Product and Issue rows into the lane of their product.

The placement rule itself lives in :func:`secretary.product_issues.product_swimlane_id` and applies
to every write.  Rows created before it, and rows a restore brought back from a checkpoint that
recorded their old lane, can still sit somewhere else, so the repair is a supported command rather
than a one-off script: it reads the board, reports what is out of place and moves only that, which
makes a second run on a board already in order a no-op.

Nothing here decides which lane a record belongs in.  The destination name comes from
``product_lane_name`` and the destination lane from ``product_swimlane_id`` - the same rule, the
same lane, as the writers.
