"""Audit and sync role-owned skills into shell-owned skill directories.

Two registries, layered. The product manifest is the portable one, read from whichever checkout
the caller names, because an upgrade can materialize a host from a checkout other than the one
running this module. An installation may own a second manifest at
``<instance>/skills/manifest.toml`` naming skills that belong to this host alone. A skill is
always read from the tree beside the manifest that declared it, so the two never have to agree
about where sources live.

A skill may also ship one command: an executable ``<skill>.sh`` beside its ``SKILL.md``, linked
into the operator's ``bin`` directory under the skill's own name.
