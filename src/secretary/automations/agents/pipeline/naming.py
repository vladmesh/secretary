"""Slug/workspace-name helpers for the task pipeline — pure functions, no I/O, no Orca.

A card's slug is validated at create time against SLUG_RE.

Workspaces already live under the project's own directory in the session manager
(`<workspaces root>/<project>/`), so repeating the project name in the workspace itself would
just echo something the path already says. `card_id` strips the reference (`<project>-<id>`, the board-CLI identity, left untouched)
down to the numeric tail a workspace or tab name is keyed off.
