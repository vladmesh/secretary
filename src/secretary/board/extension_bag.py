"""The one top-level key of a row's `extensions` bag (docs/BOARD_STORE.md §8.2).

Every metadata key the model does not name lives under `extensions[EXTENSION_BAG]` on `tasks`,
`products` and `issues`, and a card document read through `TaskReader` carries the same bag under
the same key.  Revision `0014_neutral_extension_bag` moved current rows onto this key; a record
written before it (a checkpoint, an archive) may still name another one, and `fold_extension_bags`
is the one rule that reads such a record.
