"""`TaskAudit`'s contract, kept in `requests` and `board_events` instead of in files.

`docs/BOARD_STORE.md` §7.3 is the table this module implements, row by row.  The contract callers
see is unchanged and deliberately so: the same `request_id`, the same answer to a retry with the
same id, and the same refusal — *"request id belongs to another operation or payload"* — when an
id is reused for a different operation.  What changes is where the claim lives.

* **The namespace** is `requests.request_id`, the whole installation's one primary key (§3.9),
  in place of `TaskAudit`'s index over `events.ndjson` plus `pending-audit/v2-<sha256>.json`.
* **Staged and committed** are `requests.status`, in place of a pending file and a journal line.
  `requests.intent` holds the record itself, frozen at the claim, which is what makes the
  "same operation, same payload" comparison a column comparison rather than a file read.
* **`requests.protocol`** is what makes §3.9's one permitted replacement checkable: a generic
  stage may replace a generic staged record and may never replace a protocol one.
* **`board_events`** carries the typed occurrences — the ones whose `kind` is an `EventKind` —
  so the event stream is queryable as §3.9 describes.  A *generic* audit record (`moved`,
  `edited`, `commented`, `restored_comment`, …) has no `EventKind` and therefore no
  `board_events` row; it lives in its `requests` row alone.  That is not a loss of the record,
  it is the closed vocabulary of §3.12 refusing to be widened by an adapter.
* **The per-card marker lock** is a PostgreSQL advisory lock rather than a file lock, so it is
  released by the connection rather than by a process that might die holding a file.

What is **not** implemented, because §7.3 says it ceases to exist: a card effect and its claim
are statements of one transaction (§7.1), so `reconcile` has nothing to repair and answers `(0, 0)`.

What *can* outlive its writer is a claim staged on its own, outside a transaction: `stage` and
`claim` commit a `staged` row by themselves when no transaction is open, and a process that dies
before `append` or `discard` leaves it staged for good, blocking every checkpoint.
`settle_stale_staged` is the later tick's answer (secretary-1664): a row staged longer than
`STALE_STAGED_GRACE_SECONDS` is committed when its effect is proven present, and otherwise refused
terminally in place (`discarded`, with the reason on the row), never by applying the effect.
