"""The committed board checkpoint's on-disk layout, and the one reader of it.

Contract: docs/RECOVERY.md, section "Layout". The local export in the data directory keeps its flat
files (`cards.ndjson`, `sprints.ndjson`, `events.ndjson`, `audit.ndjson`, `export.json`); only what
the checkpoint writer publishes into `state/board` of the instance repository changes shape, so a
tick's Git cost follows what changed rather than the size of the board.

Two layouts are readable:

- **flat** (every checkpoint before secretary-1656): each logical file is one file in the directory.
- **split**, marked by `layout.json`: `cards.ndjson` and `sprints.ndjson` are stored one record per
  file (`cards/0000/00000000.json`, ...), so changing one card rewrites one small blob; the
  append-only `audit.ndjson` and `events.ndjson` are stored as immutable segments
  (`audit/0000/00000000.ndjson`, ...), and a checkpoint that appended lines adds one segment.
  `export.json` and the analytics manifest stay single files.

In both layouts a logical file's bytes are the concatenation of its parts in index order, so every
consumer of a committed checkpoint reads through :func:`open_checkpoint_board` and sees the same
bytes the flat export held. Git itself is never asked here; this module only reads and writes the
working tree.
