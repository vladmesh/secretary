"""The PO service's local endpoint, seen from a submitter: the web, the upgrade, later the dispatcher.

The service (`secretary.po.service`, unit `secretary-po.service`) listens on the Unix socket
``<data_dir>/po-service/po.sock`` (mode 0600, in a 0700 directory, so only the runtime user and root
reach it). One connection carries one request, a JSON object on one line with an ``op``, and one
answer line: ``{"ok": true, "result": {...}}`` or ``{"ok": false, "error": {"code", "message"}}``.
The codes are the store's outcomes (`session_not_found`, `session_closed`, `request_conflict`,
`turn_in_progress`) plus `validation`, `unavailable` and `outcome_unknown`; :class:`PoServiceClient`
raises the store's own exception for the first four, so a caller keeps the vocabulary it had when the
runner was local. A refusal the service knows wrote nothing carries ``"nothing_written": true``, and the
raised exception an attribute of the same name; every other refusal may follow an accepted request, and
its safe repeat is the same request id.

Two failures are told apart, because a submitter acts on them differently. Before the request line is
written — no socket, the connection refused, the send failing — nothing reached the service: the
service executes only a complete line, so :class:`ServiceUnavailable` means "not running, nothing
written". After the line was written a lost or late answer is :class:`OutcomeUnknown`: the service may
have carried the request out, and the safe repeat is the same request (the same request id), which the
service answers as a replay. Nothing here falls back to running a turn: this module imports no runner.
