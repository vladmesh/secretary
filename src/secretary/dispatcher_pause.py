"""The production dispatcher's pause flag, and the legacy flag it mirrors itself into.

`ProductionPause` is the working pause, next to the production dispatcher's state in the live
data plane (`<data_dir>/dispatcher/pause.json`). The legacy flag under the pipeline worktree is
still read by the background roles, so a pause mirrors itself there and a resume removes that
mirror again — but only when the pause wrote it, never a file that was already on disk.

Semantics:

  drain  — no new claims and no background-role dispatch; cards already in flight keep riding
           their cycle to the end.
  freeze — drain, plus the live worker and reviewer heads are stopped and the tick advances
           nothing at all. Workspaces and worktrees are never removed.

A freeze set by automation carries a TTL and is resumed by the next tick once it outlives
`TA_HARD_PAUSE_AUTO_RESUME_TTL_S`, because `secretary backup create` resumes in its `finally` and
a backup killed before that block would otherwise leave the dispatcher frozen forever. A freeze
held by a human is a maintenance window and never expires.
