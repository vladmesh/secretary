"""Seed versus integration base: the two different git meanings a card's workspace block carries.

A card names at most two refs and they answer different questions:

  seed          — where the successor's checkout *starts*.  A reslice successor inherits the
                  predecessor's unreleased content, so its worktree is cut from that candidate:
                  a card branch, or the exact object id of the candidate that was assessed.
  integration   — where the increment *lands*.  It is the pull request's base, the range the
  base          candidate history is read over, the `base_sha` of the exact-SHA gate receipt and
                  the branch the merge writes to.  It is durable and shared, never a card branch.

Until issue:2c82ba8f5d1c3bf5b8cc one field, `workspace.base_branch`, carried both.  Pointing it at
a predecessor's `pipeline/*` branch opened the release pull request into that dead branch, where
the project's `pull_request` workflow does not trigger at all: GitHub created zero check-runs, the
empty rollup read as `pending`, and the card burned the gate's six-hour pending ceiling before
anybody learned anything.  Keeping the two apart is what this module is for; the rules live here
rather than in the dispatcher because the board refuses a bad card before a workspace exists.
