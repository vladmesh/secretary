"""The post-merge CI watch: a release is finished when the base's CI for its merge has answered.

A release merge starts a CI run on the integration base. The dispatcher owns all waiting for CI, so
it records a watch the moment the merge has landed (card ref, project, base, the merge commit that
actually landed, start time) in its own production state, beside the card records and never among
them: a watched card is Done and holds no claim. Each tick reads the base's CI for that exact commit
with the gate's own machinery and resolves the watch to exactly one of four results:

- `green`: every selected check finished successfully;
- `red`: at least one failed, with the run ids, failed check names and the gate's
  infrastructure/product classification;
- `absent`: the project validates without GitHub CI, or no workflow triggers on a push to the base,
  decided when the watch is opened, without waiting;
- `timeout`: no terminal result within `SECRETARY_POST_MERGE_CI_CEILING_SECONDS` (default 3600).

`read_merge_ci` is the one place the answers become green or red, and only from a reading that is
complete and exact: every answer well-formed, every check run and the status naming the full merge
commit, all check-run pages read up to `total_count`, every required check present. Anything else
(a transport error, an unreadable or malformed `gh` answer, a partial page set, a check for another
commit, a completed check with no conclusion, a run that has not started) is pending until the
ceiling, whatever the other answer says.

The result is written to the watch before anything is published, so a replayed tick publishes the
same fact under the same request ids: one card event (the observer wake, see
`secretary.tasks.is_significant_card_event`) and, for a sprint card, one dispatcher comment on the
sprint. The watch is dropped only after both are on the board.
