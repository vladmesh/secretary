"""What the dispatcher's heads in one live workspace are: alive, absent or unproven, and why.

An operator who opens a card's workspace and sees no head reads it as "the worker never started"
and intervenes by hand -- drops the claim, kills the workspace, restarts the card -- and destroys
live work. The measurement behind ``issue:84c0ae4f796f994a7c1d`` (2026-08-24, card
secretary-1450) was the counter-example: an Orca pane nothing drew, and the head behind it working.
So this command answers "is the head alive?" from the sources that observe the head, and says
which of them proved it and which could not answer.

Every head the dispatcher raises runs under a `local-pty` supervisor, and its row reads what that
backend keeps: the pid heartbeat, the supervisor's own answer, its lock and its journal. No pane
is read for any row (A20 step 5, secretary-1723). A legacy record -- a run on `orca-legacy`, or a
head identity with no durable run -- is shown as one (`legacy_record`, by the product's one
predicate `is_legacy_record`) and read through its pid heartbeat alone; it is never inventoried
through Orca.

``head_vitality``'s invariant -- pane and terminal readings are advisory and never by themselves
evidence of death -- is still printed on every row, so an operator reading one needs no module
knowledge to read it correctly.

Read-only, in the strong sense: it starts nothing, stops nothing, repairs nothing and writes
neither the dispatcher's state nor the head's, and a head whose channel cannot answer is reported
unproven rather than probed harder.
