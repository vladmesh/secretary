"""The persisted vitality episode: hysteresis over snapshots, and nothing else.

Where :mod:`head_vitality` turns one channel reading into facts, this module folds successive
snapshots of one ``HeadRun`` into a *conclusion over time* -- the ``VitalityEpisode`` of the
head-vitality plan ("Vitality reducer"): a verdict, the timestamps that justify it, the per-source
cursors that prove advancement, and the sources that went dark. ``reduce_vitality`` is the only
place conclusions live, and it is a pure function: same
inputs in, same episode out, no I/O, no clock. The caller owns ``now``, which is what keeps the
reducer testable against the historical incidents and replayable from a persisted record.

Verdict ladder, in the plan's vocabulary::

    HealthyActive   strong evidence of advancement right now
    HealthyQuiet    alive, no advancement observed yet, below every threshold
    Suspended       the kernel has the process parked on a stop signal (NOT a stall)
    Retained        the same parked process, held there by the dispatcher's OWN retention
    SuspectedStall  strong quiet has outlived ``suspect_after``
    ConfirmedStall  strong quiet has additionally outlived ``confirm_after``
    Dead            the heartbeat names a gone or unreaped process
    Unverifiable    no strong channel answered; nothing may be concluded

Decisions this module deliberately does NOT make: it never stops, signals or replaces
anything, and it treats the two thresholds as description, not authority. It neither sets nor
reads ``recovery_rung`` and its sibling policy fields (they exist for the recovery-policy card,
S1-5, and ride every reduction untouched); until that policy wired in behind them, episodes are
recorded and logged by the caller -- stored and consulted only through the decision paths the
later cards define.

The invariants encoded here (each pinned by a named test):

  * snapshots naming another run never touch an episode; a wholesale identity change starts a
    fresh episode rather than splicing a new run's facts into an old run's history;
  * ``Dead`` and ``Suspended`` outrank everything else on their axis; suspension freezes the
    stall clocks instead of feeding them;
  * a parked process whose card carries a confirmed retention reduces to ``Retained``, not to
    ``Suspended``: the caller passes that intent in as ``retained=``, so the one fact "the
    process is in ``T``" stops having two owners with opposite intentions (secretary-1539). Death
    still outranks it -- a retained head that is provably gone is ``Dead``, not ``Retained`` --
    and a retention whose process is running again is not ``Retained`` either, so the caller's
    own "no longer confirmably suspended" failure still fires;
  * advancement from any non-advisory source ends a suspected or confirmed episode immediately;
  * an unavailable source freezes its evidence and never counts as no-progress; with every strong
    source dark the truthful verdict is ``Unverifiable`` -- except that an already-confirmed
    episode is not quietly laundered back to health by its observers going blind;
  * that freeze is BOUNDED (secretary-1543): a progress source known to this episode and not
    answering holds the stall clock for at most ``thresholds.dark_ceiling``, after which the
    episode ages on the pid's own sustained "running, and nothing else" exactly as a run whose
    progress source never answered at all. A live pid is never indefinite evidence of liveness;
  * a source does not have to SAY it is unavailable to be dark: a progress source this episode has
    heard from that produces no snapshot on a tick is stamped dark too, because the status shapes
    for a live head whose pane the inventory lost carry a heartbeat and no provider channel at all;
  * a rejected report the head has not answered, followed by an advisory turn seen to END, raises
    ``HealthyQuiet`` to ``SuspectedStall`` at once (``answer_owed_since``): the pair is an
    explicit signal, not something a ceiling eventually notices;
  * advisory pane readings corroborate in ``basis`` and can never drive a stall verdict;
  * a head's child processes whose CPU or IO counters move hold the head ``HealthyActive``
    while it is itself silent (secretary-1692), but only for ``thresholds.child_activity_ceiling``
    measured from the head's own last progress; a child with frozen counters, a child past the
    ceiling and no child at all leave the ordinary quiet rules exactly as they were;
  * a head whose supervisor journal shows its turn ENDED, while the caller declares it still owes
    its answer, is judged by one rule, ``_idle_turn_stall`` (secretary-1739): suspected
    ``idle_turn_suspect_after`` and confirmed ``idle_turn_confirm_after`` after the idle turn
    began, and child processes do not hold it healthy; an open journal turn keeps every rule above;
  * quiet accumulates from ``last_progress_at`` (or episode start), not from the last tick, so
    irregular ticks cannot stretch or shrink a stall;
  * confirmation is sticky: only real progress, suspension, death or an identity change ends it.

    Defaults are chosen against the ceilings the dispatcher already lives with, for comparability
    rather than authority: ``suspect_after`` equals ``IDLE_STALL_DEFAULT`` (secretary-1063's
    five-minute readiness-idle window) -- the point where today's machinery first treats idleness
    as actionable -- and ``confirm_after`` doubles it, echoing the watchdog's principle that a
    destructive-looking conclusion wants its evidence separated in time. Both are far below the
    six-hour worker-report ceiling whose uncritical application produced the codegen-orchestrator
    incidents. Nothing in this module enforces these numbers on a decision: they parameterise a
    shadow verdict, and a later policy card owns whatever the production numbers turn out to be.

    ``dark_ceiling`` is the one number this vocabulary makes load-bearing for a real recovery
    (secretary-1543), so it is argued rather than borrowed. It bounds how long a progress source
    that is *known to this episode and not answering* may freeze the stall clock. Before this
    card the freeze was unbounded: on ``issue:7bff833fef6d9d9b404d`` (2026-08-30) a Codex head
    with no bound provider baseline sat ``healthy_quiet`` for 65+ minutes behind a live PID, with
    no wake, no replacement and no terminal outcome. Lower bound on the number: it must outlast a
    genuine provider-startup window, and secretary-1542 measured one on real Codex v0.152.1 --
    minutes, during which Orca answers ``tui-idle`` satisfied and the output cursor never moves,
    so nothing else distinguishes a starting head from a settled one. Upper bound: it must stay
    far below the six-hour worker-report ceiling whose uncritical application produced the
    codegen-orchestrator incidents, and it must leave the wake early enough to be worth having.
    Two ``IDLE_STALL_DEFAULT`` (ten minutes) sits between them: a dark-and-quiet head earns its
    first conversational nudge at ``max(dark_ceiling, suspect_after)`` -- ten minutes instead of
    never -- while nothing destructive happens before ``suspect_after + confirm_after`` of quiet
    AND the guard's own outer ceiling (:mod:`head_vitality_guard`).

    ``child_activity_ceiling`` (secretary-1692) bounds how long a head that is itself silent may
    be held healthy by its child processes' CPU or IO alone, measured from the head's own last
    progress. Lower bound: the longest single command a worker legitimately runs in the
    foreground -- two integration shards under ``timeout 580`` each (secretary-1665) or one
    broad suite, i.e. up to roughly twenty minutes -- with room for a slow host. Upper bound: a
    hung child that spins (a busy-looping test, a retry loop) must still be caught in the same
    hour, far below the six-hour report ceiling. Forty-five minutes sits between them; past it
    the child's movement is ignored and the ordinary ladder runs from the last child advancement
    it accepted, so such a head is suspected at about 50 and confirmed at about 60 minutes.

    ``idle_turn_suspect_after`` and ``idle_turn_confirm_after`` (secretary-1739) are the idle-turn
    stall, and unlike the pair above both are measured from ONE instant: when the head's journal
    turn became idle. The shape they judge is not "quiet while working" but "finished and
    silent": the supervisor closed the turn after two seconds with no terminal output at all --
    a working provider's TUI redraws its spinner or timer many times a second, and across the
    sixty most recent local-pty journals on the production host (2026-09) the only output outside
    a delivered turn is the bring-up banner and what a head prints after its last turn, so no turn
    was seen to close mid-work -- and the head still owes the dispatcher its report or verdict.
    Nothing is running to wait for, so the quiet ladder's fifteen minutes protect nothing here.
    Lower bound: the dispatcher's own latency in accepting an answer the head just wrote (one
    tick, about a minute) plus room for a delivery that is about to land. Upper bound: the card
    asks that a stall be confirmed in minutes, at most ten. Suspicion at five minutes spends the
    one report nudge (whose delivery opens a turn and restarts this clock); confirmation at ten
    reaches the recovery path. A head whose journal turn is open keeps the quiet ladder and the
    child-process hold exactly as before.

    ``previous`` is the persisted episode for the run (``None`` before the first). ``snapshots``
    are this tick's observations, in any order -- duplicates collapse to each source's latest
    reading. The function never reads a clock, a file or a host: everything it concludes is a
    function of its arguments, which is what makes a persisted episode replayable and its tests
    able to reproduce historical incidents tick by tick.

    ``retained`` is the caller's declaration that this run is parked on a stop signal the
    dispatcher itself sent and still holds (a confirmed ``WorkerContinuation`` retention). It is
    an INPUT, not an observation: the reducer cannot tell an intentional SIGSTOP from a hostile
    one, and guessing is what let the watchdog SIGCONT a retained worker out from under the gate
    (secretary-1539). It changes exactly one thing -- a suspended reading becomes ``Retained``
    instead of ``Suspended`` -- and nothing else about the fold.

    ``answer_owed_since`` is the other caller-declared fact (secretary-1543): the instant the
    dispatcher put a question to this head that it has not answered. The wait tick declares it
    for a worker before its report is accepted and a reviewer before its verdict -- the bring-up
    or delivery that opened the phase, or a rejected done report, whichever is later
    (``wait_vitality.answer_owed_since_for_wait``) -- and every other caller passes 0.0. Like
    ``retained`` it is an INPUT: the reducer cannot see the board. It feeds two rules. The
    idle-turn stall (``_idle_turn_stall``, secretary-1739) judges a head whose supervisor journal
    shows its turn ended, never charging it with idleness from before the question. And when the
    head owes an answer that no
    progress has followed AND the advisory Turn axis has been seen to END a turn since the
    question was put (``active`` then ``idle``), a ``HealthyQuiet`` verdict is raised to
    ``SuspectedStall`` at once instead of waiting out the quiet thresholds: a head that took its
    turn, ended it and answered nothing is not quiet-below-threshold, it is finished and silent.
    The advisory reading still cannot convict on its own -- with no owed answer it stays exactly
    as weightless as before -- and it can never raise anything but ``HealthyQuiet``, so it lowers
    no verdict and launders no confirmation.

    It decides only when all three hold: the ``supervisor_journal`` snapshot answered, it says the
    head's turn is ``Idle``, and the caller declares an owed answer (``answer_owed_since`` > 0: a
    worker before its report is accepted, a reviewer before its verdict). Otherwise it returns
    ``None`` and the ordinary arms decide exactly as before -- an open turn keeps the quiet
    ladder and the child hold, and a head that owes nothing (the gate phase) is not judged here.

    The idle turn is charged from ``reference``, the latest of: the journal's own idle start (the
    last ``turn.finished``, or a later ``input.accepted``/``turn.started``, so the delivery that
    resumes a continued worker restarts the clock), the instant the answer became owed (a head is
    never charged with idleness from before it was asked), and a nudge's ``quiet_since``. From
    there it climbs to ``SuspectedStall`` at ``idle_turn_suspect_after`` and ``ConfirmedStall`` at
    ``idle_turn_confirm_after``, both measured from that one instant.

    Child processes do NOT hold it: a head at its prompt is not running the command its children
    are, and a child that keeps moving there is a helper, not the head's work
    (``child-not-holding-idle-turn`` in ``basis``). Nor does a turn ending launder a stall the
    episode already holds (an open turn that went quiet long enough to be suspected, then closed):
    that verdict stands (``stall-stands``) unless the dispatcher has restarted the head since it
    began -- a new owed answer or a nudge's ``quiet_since`` -- which is what a restart means
    everywhere else in this module. Advancement, death and suspension are decided by the arms
    above this one and never reach it.
