"""Delegated cards: a card returns its result to the PO session that cut it (secretary-1792).

A card created inside a PO turn carries its origin (`board/po_origin.py`). Each of its transitions into
Done or Blocked owes that session one input, and the owner's bell one notice, through the path every
dispatcher result takes to a PO session (`dispatch/po_delivery.py`): a closed or missing origin session
gets a successor, a service that does not answer postpones the delivery to the next tick, and nothing is
given up.

What is owed is written down when it becomes owed. The store writes one row of the origin-return
outbox (`board/origin_outbox.py`, table `origin_returns`) in the transaction that commits the
transition's audit event (`SqlTaskAudit.append`): the move, its event and the obligation stand or fall
together, whoever made the move, and archive, reopen or any later move touch no row. Nothing here scans
cards or infers from a card's present column what it owes.

:func:`pending_returns` is the one rule and the only thing that decides what is returned: the
undelivered outbox rows, oldest first, one indexed query per tick. Each row is made on its own: its
event is fetched from the card's audit by its event id (an archived card's audit included) and rendered
from that event (the column it entered, when, its result), never from the card's present state; then
the submit (idempotent by request id), the notice through the bell's strict writer
(`owner_events.record_strict`) and, only when both were accepted, the row is marked delivered. The row
is the only delivery record. The first row of a card that does not complete stops that card for the
tick, and its later rows wait; other cards go on. A notice that failed marks nothing, and the next tick
repeats both under the same keys: the submit is the earlier input to the service, the notice a no-op on
its key. A crash anywhere in between is repaired the same way. An installation with no board store at
all has no bell to wait for, and the delivery completes without it. A marked row is never selected
again.

Two exceptions. A wait card owes no row (the store does not write one): it delivers through its own
return addresses. A Done whose completion transition records the PO session that ran `task complete`
(`po_session`, from that turn's `SECRETARY_PO_SESSION`), where that session is the origin or one of its
recorded successors, was completed in a turn of the origin's line, which already has the result: its row
is marked `skipped`, with no input and no notice. Anything else is delivered: a completion by another
session, one that ran outside a PO turn, any other Done, and every Blocked. The session the dispatcher
handed the card to (`po_return.executor`) proves nothing and is not asked.
