"""secretary-1412: what the head operations share, without a session manager.

The Orca pane versions of `spawn` / `nudge` / `stop` and the fake session host their contract ran
on were removed in secretary-1725; the verbs are now `HeadRuntime`'s, and their contract suite runs
against the local-pty backend in `test_local_pty_head_runtime`. What is pinned here is what every
backend shares:

  * a delivery callback cannot hand back a run that is not the launched one (`post_delivery_run`);
  * a stop records who initiated it, and that initiator survives the record being written and read
    back — which is what "the dispatcher restarted" looks like from inside a run;
  * a head can be pointed at a card, a sprint entity or a role's standing instruction, because the
    observer and the mechanical roles have no card and one must not be invented for them;
  * the package reaches no session manager and spawns no process — asserted by reading its own
    source. That is a source check and it proves only what a source check can.
