"""Starting boards for the card store, and the sprint stand-in the card create path needs.

Cards have one implementation, PostgreSQL, so there is no in-memory card board here. A `CardSeed`
is only seed input: `tests.sql_backend_fixtures.card_store` writes it into a real store through the
product's own client. The rows keep the legacy board shape the importer reads (`column_id`,
`swimlane_id`, `date_creation`), because that is what `seed_client` takes; a card keeps its row id
as its `board_key`, so `task_postgres_12` is the first card of every seed below.
