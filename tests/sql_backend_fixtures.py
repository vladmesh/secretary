"""A throwaway `postgres:16`, and the seeding that puts a starting board into it.

Cards have one implementation, the PostgreSQL one, so every test that needs a card board gets a
real store: `card_store()` hands a test its own migrated database, seeded from a `CardSeed`
(`tests/fakes/tasks.py`) through the same `SqlCardClient` the product uses, and removes it when the
test ends. Nothing here reaches a live installation: the container publishes on loopback, holds no
volume, is addressed only by the id `docker run` returned, and is removed when the process exits.

There is no skip.  `tests/test_board_store_schema.py` states the reason and it is the same one
here: a backend proof that quietly passes because it never reached a database is worth less than
no proof at all.  The suites that use it are the integration shards, where Docker and the core
dependencies are both present.
