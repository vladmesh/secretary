"""Deterministic inspection of a candidate branch's own commit messages.

The pipeline's git history is a published artefact: once a worker's commits reach `origin` the
ordinary repair is no longer available, and the only remaining fixes are the two this product
refuses to automate. So the one check that has to happen *before* publication is the one over
what the commits say. This module reads commit messages and nothing else — no diff, no working
tree, no network — and names the commits rather than repairing them.

A commit message is untrusted input: written by the head under review, it may contain any byte
git accepts, and a candidate that wants to hide a trailer will put whatever it takes in it. Two
consequences run through this module:

  * Nothing here frames records inside message text. The caller reads object ids first, from a
    format that cannot be forged, then one message per id, so there is no delimiter a message can
    contain to break the parse into a shape that reads as "no trailers".
  * Addressed identities are compared to an exact registry of name/address pairs. Neither a model
    vendor's domain nor an ambiguous local part is evidence on its own.

The identity lists are deliberately narrow: the cost of a false positive is a green candidate
bounced back to a worker over a colleague's name.
